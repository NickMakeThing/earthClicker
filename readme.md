# earthClicker

I made earthClicker as a means to get back into writing React and frontend code. As using react is not ideal making games. The game is not complete and I did not complete it as I achieved my goal of refamiliarizing myself with React.  
A demonstration of the game being played can be seen [here](https://streamable.com/jdff57)  
Its not exactly clear what most of these buttons do as I didn't end up implementing the descriptions.  
  
Here are descriptions for each button used in the demonstration:
* Autoclicker will simulate a click for the user at regular intervals.  
* Manual Clicks will generate 20% more resources per manual click.  
* Giddy Up gives each manual click a chance to reduce the time before the next automatic click occurs.  
* Lucky Manual Clicks gives a chance on each manual click to increase the amount of resources earned from an automatic click.  
* Spawn gives a chance on each manual click to create an extra autoclicker that exists temporarily.
